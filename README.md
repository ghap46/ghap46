Hello, I'm just a guy trying to get better at writing C++ code. I have little to no interest in programming languages other than C/C++ and the Assembly family of languages since I study programming just for fun. I'm currently trying to learn OpenGL so I can write some mathematical visualization software for personal use. I'm not exactly new to C/C++, but I wouldn't call me nothing near proficient.  In the rare case that you'd like to contact me, you can e-mail me on gabrielperes46@gmail.com
