Hello, I'm just a guy trying to get better at writing C code. I have little to no interest in programming languages other than C and the Assembly family of languages since I study programming just for fun. I'm currently trying to learn OpenGL so I can write some plotting software for personal use. I'm not exactly new to C, but I wouldn't call me anywhere near proficient.  In the rare case that you'd like to contact me, you can e-mail me on gabrielperes46@gmail.com
